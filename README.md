## TypeScript Design Patterns Summary

Hereâ€™s a quick recap of the Design Patterns we've covered with TypeScript examples:

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory**: Provides an interface to create objects without specifying their exact type.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Makes incompatible interfaces work together by acting as a bridge.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their structure.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes, often used in event systems.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo operations.
